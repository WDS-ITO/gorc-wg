  <figcaption>This figure shows the number of items (attributes, features, KPIs) that were found within a specific number of sources in the Phase 1 review for the GORC-WG. The full data can be found in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SiWnZRwkmbGuAX1sS33EWLqyRJDQWgkXj8l1EwdQsi0/edit#gid=1956922114">GORC-WG Attributes Running List in the Sources Cross Walk tab </a>. There were 42 sources used in Phase 1, resulting in 583 unqiue attributes, features, and KPIs that are currently under review. 14 sources were from external bodies to RDA, and 28 resources were direct outputs and recommendations created by RDA IGs and WGs. The GORC-WG speaker series was considered a RDA output in this case. As seen above, the majority of attributes, features, and KPIs were found in more than one source. For the 583 items, there were 1720 mentions - leading to an average of each item being referenced in 3 sources. Out of the 1720 mentions, 1162 (67.56%) were from RDA outputs and 558 (32.44%) were from external sources.</figcaption>
