  <figcaption>Breakdown of the number of times that 583 unique items (attributes, features, KPIs) were found in the 42 sources in the Phase 1 document review of the GORC-WG.  All items were referenced a total of 1720 times across all sources.

The majority of items were found in more than one source; on average each item was referenced in 3 sources. </figcaption>
