<h1>Attributes and Features sources overlap</h1>
  <p>During the phase 1 document review to find attributes, features, and KPIs of research commons (items) to inform the GORC-WG goal of identifying what is necessary for research commons to be GORCs, it was found that some items were referenced and discussed in more than one source. This page showcases some of the high-level results from the data collected to create a sources cross walk, which showcases how many and which sources refer to every one of the 583 items identified in Phase 1.</p>  
  <p>The full data, with filters that allow you to explore the data, can be found in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SiWnZRwkmbGuAX1sS33EWLqyRJDQWgkXj8l1EwdQsi0/edit#gid=1956922114">GORC-WG Attributes Running List in the Sources Cross Walk tab</a>. These figures will be updated during the Phase II review that will include additional sources, starting after March 2023.</p>

  <figcaption>Caption: Breakdown of the number of times that 583 unique items (attributes, features, KPIs) were found in the 42 sources in the Phase 1 document review of the GORC-WG.  All items were referenced a total of 1720 times across all sources. As an example, it should be read as follows: "197 attributes, features, and/or KPIs were referred to in 2 sources; these 197 account for 33.8 percent of all items (attributes, features, KPIs) identified by the WG."  The majority of items were found in more than one source; on average each item was referenced in 3 sources. </figcaption>

  <p>The top items receiving the most mentions are all metadata standards, specifically "Metadata is offered in such a way that it can be harvested and indexed" referenced in 18 sources, "Metadata contains links to related research products (e.g. article and dataset, dataset and software, software and article)" also referenced in 18 sources, and "Metadata includes information about the licence under which the data can be reused" referenced in 20 sources.</p>

    <figcaption>Caption: This figure shows the number of attributes, features, and KPIs found in each phase 1 source. 14 sources were from external bodies to RDA (represented by light colours), and 28 resources were direct outputs and recommendations created by RDA IGs and WGs, including GORC-WG speaker series (represented by dark colours). Out of the 1720 references to items, 1162 (67.56%) were from RDA outputs and 558 (32.44%) were from external sources.</figcaption>
